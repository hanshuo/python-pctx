This is a Python wrapper for the Endurance PCTx driver (in C++) for Linux,
which is originally written by Wade Smith. The files have been slightly
modified to ensure compatibility with Python. An original copy of the C++
driver is available at:

====== Required Packages ======

  - SWIG (tested under 1.3)
  - libusb-1.0-dev
  - Python setuptools

Under Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS (Lucid), they can be obtained by:
    
  $ apt-get install swig libusb-1.0-0-dev python-setuptools

====== Installation ======

To install:

  $ python setup.py install

To run the test programs:

  $ make (this for C/C++ only)
  $ ./pctx_test (in C/C++)
  $ python pctx_test.py (in Python)


====== Set permissions to PCTx automatically ======

Normally, the PCTx is only writable with root privilege, which is not
convenient to use. One quick fix is to run the following every time the
PCTx is plugged in:

  $ chmod 777 /dev/bus/usb/00?/00?

You will need to replace the above with the correct bus and device ID,
which can be found by running "lsusb".

Another more efficient way is to set up a udev rule. You can copy
"pctx.rules" that comes with the driver to the udev rule directory, and
then reload the rules:
 
  $ cp pctx.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  $ udevadm control --reload-rules
